### Cell 1: Importing Libraries

In this cell, we import the necessary Python libraries for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Here's a brief overview of each library imported:

- **numpy (np):** NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
  
- **pandas (pd):** Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It offers data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are ideal for handling structured data such as CSV files or database tables.
  
- **train_test_split:** This function from scikit-learn is essential for splitting datasets into training and testing subsets. It helps in assessing the performance of machine learning models on unseen data by keeping a portion of the data separate for testing purposes.
  
- **LogisticRegression:** Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class using a logistic function. Logistic Regression is widely used for its simplicity and interpretability.
  
- **accuracy_score:** Accuracy score is a metric from scikit-learn used for evaluating classification models. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances. Accuracy is a simple and intuitive metric but may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.

These libraries provide essential functionality for building and evaluating machine learning models. In the subsequent cells, we'll use these libraries to preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.

### Cell 2: Loading of Data
This line of code reads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file named 'creditcard.csv' and stores it in a pandas DataFrame named 'credit_card_data'. 

Pandas' `read_csv()` function is used to read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame. This function automatically detects the delimiter used in the file (usually a comma) and parses the data into rows and columns. The resulting DataFrame allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the dataset, making it a popular choice for working with structured data in Python.


### Cell 3: Exploring Dataset
- **First 5 rows of the dataset:** To display the initial entries of the dataset, the `.head()` method is employed. This method retrieves the first few rows of the DataFrame, providing a glimpse into its structure and contents. It's particularly useful for quickly examining the dataset's layout and the types of data it contains.

- **Last 5 rows of the dataset:** Conversely, to access the final entries of the dataset, the `.tail()` method is utilized. Similar to `.head()`, `.tail()` returns the last few rows of the DataFrame, offering insight into the dataset's concluding records. This function aids in verifying data integrity and completeness, especially when assessing data ordering or potential truncation issues.

- **Dataset information:** The `.info()` method furnishes a concise summary of the DataFrame's composition and structure. It includes essential details such as the number of entries, data types of each column, and memory usage. This overview facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's attributes, assisting in initial data inspection and potential preprocessing steps.

### Cell 4: Data Preparation

- **Checking the number of missing values in each column:** The expression `credit_card_data.isnull().sum()` is utilized to assess the presence of missing values within each column of the dataset. This command computes the sum of missing values across all columns, providing valuable insight into data completeness. Identifying missing data is crucial for subsequent data cleaning and imputation procedures, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of analyses and models.

- **Distribution of legitimate transactions & fraudulent transactions:** The `credit_card_data['Class'].value_counts()` expression is employed to examine the distribution of classes within the 'Class' column of the dataset. By calling `.value_counts()` on the 'Class' column, the number of occurrences for each unique class label (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions) is computed. Understanding the distribution of classes is pivotal for addressing class imbalances and formulating appropriate strategies for model training and evaluation.

- **Separating the data for analysis:** To facilitate separate analysis of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the dataset is partitioned into two subsets: 'legit' containing records corresponding to legitimate transactions (Class = 0), and 'fraud' containing records corresponding to fraudulent transactions (Class = 1). This segregation enables targeted exploration, feature engineering, and modeling specific to each class, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of fraud detection algorithms and strategies.

### Cell 5: Data Analysis

- **Checking the shape of legitimate and fraudulent transactions:** The `print(legit.shape)` and `print(fraud.shape)` commands provide information about the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the 'legit' and 'fraud' subsets of the dataset, respectively. Understanding the size of each subset is essential for assessing the relative prevalence of legitimate and fraudulent transactions and gauging the dataset's overall composition.

- **Statistical measures of the transaction amounts:** The `legit.Amount.describe()` and `fraud.Amount.describe()` commands compute various statistical measures (such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) of the transaction amounts for legitimate and fraudulent transactions, respectively. These summary statistics offer insights into the typical transaction amounts and their variability within each class, aiding in understanding the underlying distribution of transaction values and identifying potential anomalies or patterns.

- **Comparing the values for both transaction classes:** By comparing the statistical measures of transaction amounts between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, we gain insights into potential differences in transaction behavior between the two classes. Understanding these distinctions can inform the development of fraud detection algorithms and strategies, enabling the identification of anomalous transactions characteristic of fraudulent activity.

- **Grouping and computing mean values by transaction class:** The `credit_card_data.groupby('Class').mean()` command groups the dataset by the 'Class' column (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions) and computes the mean value for each numerical attribute within each class. This analysis provides a comparative overview of the average values of different transaction attributes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, highlighting potential discrepancies or patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

### Cell 6: Data Sampling and Consolidation

- **Sampling legitimate transactions:** The `legit_sample = legit.sample(n=492)` command selects a random sample of legitimate transactions from the 'legit' subset of the dataset. In this case, 492 legitimate transactions are sampled, aiming to balance the dataset with the number of fraudulent transactions.

- **Consolidating the datasets:** The `new_dataset = pd.concat([legit_sample, fraud], axis=0)` command concatenates the sampled legitimate transactions (`legit_sample`) with the original fraudulent transactions (`fraud`) along the rows (axis=0). This consolidation creates a new dataset (`new_dataset`) with a balanced distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, facilitating more equitable model training and evaluation.

- **Viewing the first few rows of the new dataset:** The `new_dataset.head()` command displays the initial entries of the `new_dataset`, providing a glimpse into its structure and contents. Examining the first few rows aids in verifying the concatenation process and ensuring the integrity of the new dataset.

- **Viewing the last few rows of the new dataset:** Similarly, the `new_dataset.tail()` command showcases the final entries of the `new_dataset`, offering insight into its concluding records. This examination assists in confirming the completeness of the dataset and identifying any potential issues with data concatenation.

- **Distribution of classes in the new dataset:** The `new_dataset['Class'].value_counts()` command computes the frequency of each class label (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions) within the `new_dataset`. Understanding the class distribution is crucial for assessing the balance of the dataset and its suitability for subsequent modeling tasks.

- **Grouping and computing mean values by transaction class in the new dataset:** The `new_dataset.groupby('Class').mean()` command groups the `new_dataset` by the 'Class' column and computes the mean value for each numerical attribute within each class. This analysis provides a comparative overview of the average values of different transaction attributes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions in the balanced dataset, facilitating insights into potential differences or patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

### Cell 7: Data Splitting for Model Training and Testing

- **Creating feature matrix and target vector:** The `X = new_dataset.drop(columns='Class', axis=1)` command generates the feature matrix (`X`) by removing the 'Class' column from the `new_dataset`. Similarly, the `Y = new_dataset['Class']` command creates the target vector (`Y`), containing only the 'Class' column from the `new_dataset`. This separation ensures that the features and target are appropriately defined for subsequent model training and evaluation.

- **Displaying the feature matrix and target vector:** The `print(X)` and `print(Y)` commands output the contents of the feature matrix (`X`) and target vector (`Y`), respectively. Examining these components provides insight into the dataset's structure and confirms the correct extraction of features and target labels for further analysis.

- **Splitting the data into training and testing sets:** The `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn is employed to partition the feature matrix (`X`) and target vector (`Y`) into training and testing subsets. The `test_size=0.2` parameter specifies that 20% of the data will be allocated for testing, while the remaining 80% will be used for training. Additionally, `stratify=Y` ensures that the class distribution is preserved in both the training and testing sets, and `random_state=2` sets the random seed for reproducibility.

- **Displaying the dimensions of the datasets:** The `print(X.shape, X_train.shape, X_test.shape)` command outputs the shapes of the feature matrix (`X`), training feature matrix (`X_train`), and testing feature matrix (`X_test`). Similarly, it provides insight into the size and dimensions of the datasets, aiding in verifying the correctness of the data splitting process and ensuring consistency between training and testing subsets.

### Cell 8: Logistic Regression Model Training and Evaluation

- **Initializing the Logistic Regression model:** The `model = LogisticRegression()` command creates an instance of the Logistic Regression model. Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

- **Training the Logistic Regression Model with Training Data:** The `model.fit(X_train, Y_train)` command trains the Logistic Regression model using the training feature matrix (`X_train`) and corresponding target vector (`Y_train`). This process involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual class labels on the training data.

- **Accuracy on Training Data:** After training the model, the accuracy on the training data is evaluated using the `accuracy_score` function. The predicted class labels (`X_train_prediction`) are compared with the actual class labels (`Y_train`), and the accuracy score is computed. This metric indicates the proportion of correctly predicted instances in the training dataset.

- **Displaying Accuracy on Training Data:** The `print('Accuracy on Training data : ', training_data_accuracy)` command outputs the accuracy score obtained on the training data. Understanding the model's performance on the training set is essential for assessing its ability to learn from the provided data.

- **Accuracy on Test Data:** Similarly, the accuracy of the model is evaluated on the test data using the `accuracy_score` function. The predicted class labels (`X_test_prediction`) are compared with the actual class labels (`Y_test`), and the accuracy score is computed.

- **Displaying Accuracy on Test Data:** The `print('Accuracy score on Test Data : ', test_data_accuracy)` command outputs the accuracy score achieved on the test data. Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data helps assess its generalization ability and effectiveness in making predictions on new, unseen instances.
